In the Disaggregation_MR folder, you will find the total disaggregation files for a selected return period, 
which in this case is 475 years, and for the chosen spectral periods. 
The purpose of this is to analyze the behavior of magnitude-distance 
relationships across multiple structural periods and their contribution to the seismic hazard by environment.

The Disaggregation_slab folder contains all the specific disaggregation files (for the selected environment) 
corresponding to the chosen return periods and structural period. It is important to verify that the filenames follow the proposed format.
